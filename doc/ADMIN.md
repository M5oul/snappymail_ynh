The password-file is created after first opening the admin UI!

Be sure to immediately change the default password!

Open Snappy's admin UI `https://__DOMAIN____PATH__/app/?admin` to configure your mail server settings. Login with user "admin" and password from the file `__INSTALL_DIR__/app/data/_data_/_default_/admin_password.txt`.

In particular, to be able to send emails, you need to go to Snappy's admin UI > Domains > __DOMAIN__ > SMTP > Check "Use authentication"
